There are only 2 changes and they are the following:

### Water

---
- Cannot place water source blocks. Instead the water dissipates shortly after placed.
- Waterlogged blocks && Ice block dissipate their held water when broken.
>This aims to promote the player to create water channels to move the water around and also plays a significant role when choosing a spot for a base.

### Lava

---
- Completely not acquirable via bucket.
>Lava contraptions should be built only where lava is present.
